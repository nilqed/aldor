\Descr{\this~V implements the 
 exponents of the monomials (or power products) generated by the finite 
 set of variables $V.$ Such an exponent is represented by a primtive 
 array of machine integers with length $dim = n + 1$ where $n$ is the
 number of elements in $V.$ Given $e$ in \% and $i$ in $1 \cdots n$ the
 degree of $e$ w.r.t. the $i$-th variable of $V$ is stored in slot $i$. Slot $0$
 is used to store the total degree of $e$, that is the sum of the content 
 of all the other slots. An exponent $a$ is greater than an exponent $b$ 
 if $a$ is greater than $b$ w.r.t. the degree-lexicographical 
 ordering induced by $V$ (by comparing $a_i$ and $b_i$ for $i$ running
 from $1$ to $n$, after comparing the total degrees of $a$ and $b$). }
