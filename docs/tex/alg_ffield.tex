\Usage{\this: Category}
\Descr{\this~is the category of finite fields.}
\begin{exports}
\category{\altype{Field}}\\
\category{\altype{FiniteCharacteristic}}\\
\category{\altype{FiniteSet}}\\
\alexp{degree}: & \altype{Integer} & Dimension over the prime field\\
\alexp{pthRoot}: & \% $\to$ \% & Exponentiation to 1 over the characteristic\\
\alexp{pthRoot!}:
& \% $\to$ \% & In-place exponentiation to 1 over the characteristic\\
\end{exports}
\alpage{degree}
\Usage{\name}
\alconstant{\altype{Integer}}
\Retval{Returns the extension degree of the field, \ie~its dimension
as a vector space over its prime fields. In other words, the size
of the field is $p^\name$ where {\em p} is the characteristic.}
\alpage{pthRoot}
\altarget{\name!}
\Usage{\name~x\\ \name!~x}
\Signature{\%}{\%}
\Params{ {\em x} & \% & An element of the ring\\ }
\Retval{Return {\em y} such that $y^p = x$ where $p$ is the characteristic
of the field.}
\Remarks{\name!~does not make a copy of $x$, which is therefore
modified after the call. It is unsafe to use the variable $x$
after the call, unless it has been assigned to the result
of the call, as in {\tt x := pthPower!~x}.}
