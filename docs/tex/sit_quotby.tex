\Usage{import from \this(R, p, irr?)}
\Params{
{\em R} & \astype{IntegralDomain} & an integral domain\\
{\em p} & R & a nonzero nonunit of R\\
{\em irr?} & \astype{Boolean} &
Indicates whether p is known to be irreducible in R\\
}
\Descr{
\this(R, p, irr?) forms the fractions of the integral domain {\em R} by the
nonzero nonunit {\em p}, \ie the set of all fractions whose denominator is a
power of {\em p}. Fractions are normalized in the sense that {\em p}
does not divide the numerators. Indicating whether {\em p} is
irreducible if for efficiency purposes only, always use \false~when
it is unknown.
