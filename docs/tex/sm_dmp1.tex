\Descr{\this~(R,V,E) provides a basic domain for 
multivariate polynomials with coefficients in $R$ and variables 
in $V.$ 
The monomials are coded by means of exponents
 from $E.$
Polynomials are represented in a sparse and distributed way.
This means that each polynomial $x$ is coded
as a list of term $(r,e)$ with $r \in R, r\neq 0$ and $e \in E$
such that $x$ is the sum of these terms.}
